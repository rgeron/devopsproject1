- **[Arcjet](https://jsm.dev/dops25-arcjet)** is a developer-first security layer that enables you to protect your applications with minimal code. It offers features like bot protection, rate limiting, email validation, and defense against common attacks. Arcjet's SDK integrates seamlessly into your application, providing real-time security decisions without the need for additional infrastructure.


- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** is a leading containerization platform that allows you to package applications along with all their dependencies into portable, lightweight containers. This ensures consistent behavior across different environments, simplifies deployment, and makes scaling applications more efficient.  

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)** is an open-source orchestration system designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It handles tasks like load balancing, self-healing, and rolling updates, making it essential for running applications reliably at scale.  

- **[Warp](https://jsm.dev/dops25-warp)** is a modern terminal built in Rust, optimized for developer productivity. It offers features like AI-assisted commands, easy collaboration, command history search, and a faster, more intuitive interface compared to traditional terminals.  

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** is a fast, event-driven JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine. It enables developers to build scalable, high-performance server-side applications and APIs using JavaScript on both the client and server side.  

- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It provides robust features for building APIs and server-side applications, including routing, middleware support, and simplified request/response handling.  

- **[Neon Postgres](https://jsm.dev/dops25-neon)** is a fully managed, serverless Postgres database designed for modern cloud applications. It offers autoscaling, branching for development workflows, and simplifies database management without compromising performance.  

- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)** is a TypeScript-first, lightweight ORM for SQL databases. It provides type safety, schema migrations, and an intuitive API for building reliable and maintainable database queries.  

- **[Zod](https://zod.dev/)** is a TypeScript-first schema validation library that ensures runtime type safety. It helps developers validate data structures, enforce strict type checks, and catch errors early in the development process.  

## <a name="features">🔋 Features</a>

👉 **Absolute Imports**: Clean import paths using `#` prefix aliases for more organized and readable code.  

👉 **Business Listings**: Create, update, delete, and browse business listings efficiently.
